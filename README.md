# Restaurant Website

This project is a Web application for a website of a food Restaurant.

I have developed this application using React and Javascript. I have used Redux to store the state globally into the application
and to gain the benefits of the flux architecture.

The Data coming into the application is stored into a simple json-web-server

To use my project follow the steps given below :

- clone the github repo using the CLI or the GUI in Github

- then go to the copied directory and open the terminal

- now type : npm install

- bring the server up by typing : json-web-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000

- now initiate the 'npm start' for the react server

- the browser open itself and the application is up and running
